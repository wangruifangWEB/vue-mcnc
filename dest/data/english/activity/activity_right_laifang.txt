He taught applied math at MIT in 1974-76 and math, statistics and CS at Univ of Illinois, Chicago in 1976-79. After working on switching systems and theoretic research at Bell Labs/Bellcore for a decade, he joined CUHK as a chair professor in 1989. He now also serves as Co-director of Institute of Network Coding.Bob Li is a cofounder of the theory of network coding. The paper “Linear Network Coding” won the IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award of Year 2005. His “martingale of patterns” (1980) engenders a research area with applications to genetics and other fields. The “algebraic switching fabric” adopted by the “Metro Switch” project of ITRI in Taiwan is derived from his book “Algebraic Switching Theory and Broadband Applications” (2001). He holds 32 US patents. He came to the lab and conmunicated with the students who worked in MCNC.",
