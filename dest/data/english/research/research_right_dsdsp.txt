    "content": "Multi-view acquisition systems based on multiple texture cameras leads to two problems：the huge data volume and the lack of depth information. Considering the  limitations above, this project proposes a novel framework based on multiple  depth cameras and less texture cameras for multi-view acquisition and  reconstruction. Our research is sponsored by the State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(NO.61231010). ",
