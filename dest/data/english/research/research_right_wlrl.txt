    "content": "Capacity is an important QoS performance of wireless ad hoc networks. We mainly focus on the asymptotic analysis of  the capacity in large scale wireless networks with multi-hop routing protocols, and different traffic patterns are considered during our research. Moreover, we are interested in the tradeoff between network capacity and delay.",
